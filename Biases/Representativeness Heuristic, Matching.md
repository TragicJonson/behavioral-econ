When weâ€™re trying to assess how likely a certain event is, we often make our decision by assessing how similar it is to an existing mental prototype, ignoring base rates and any doubts about the legitimacy of the description of the event. "One sin of representativeness is an excessive willingness to predict the occurence of unlikely (low base-rate) events" (TFAS)

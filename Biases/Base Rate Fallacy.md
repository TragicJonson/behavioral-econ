When provided with both individuating information, which is specific to a certain person or event, and base rate information, which is objective, statistical information, we tend to assign greater value to the specific information and often ignore the base rate information altogether. "Subjects' willingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingess to infer the general from the particular" (Nisbett and Borgida)

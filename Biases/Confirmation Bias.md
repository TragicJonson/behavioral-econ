We look for information that supports our existing beliefs and ignore what doesn’t. "Understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only then can you decide whether or not to unbelieve it. The initial attempt to believe is an automatic operation of System 1... A deliberate search for confirming evidence is how System 2 tests a hypothesis" (TFAS)

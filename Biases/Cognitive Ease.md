When you feel "ease" via perceived familiarity, a good mood, repetition, or information clarity, you are more likely to believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and be relatively casual and superficial in your thinking. "Good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility, and increase reliance on System 1 form a cluster" ... "Frowning... generally increases the vigilance of System 2 and both reduces overconfidence and the reliance on intuition"

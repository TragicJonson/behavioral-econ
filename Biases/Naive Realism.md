The tendency to believe our perception of the world reflects it exactly as it is, unbiased and unfiltered. We don’t think our emotions, past experiences, or cultural identity affect the way we perceive the world and thus believe others see it in the same way as we do. Naive realism rests on the idea that there is a material, objective world accessible to us and others around us.

Naive realism is within the egocentric bias category, a group of biases that indicate we rely too heavily on our own point of view and fail to understand that it is a personal point of view. These biases make it difficult for us to understand other people’s perspectives and can lead to arguments and polarization.

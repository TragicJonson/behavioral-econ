Difficult questions are often automatically and unconsciously substituted in for more difficult questions. This is the basis of heuristics and bias. This occurs when System 2 must make a decision quickly. This results in you often having "answers to questions that you don't completely understand, relying on evidence you can neither expain nor defend" ... "This is why subjective confidence is not a good diagnostic of accuracy: judgments that answer the wrong question can also be made with high confidence"

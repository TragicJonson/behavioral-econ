Our judgements are heavily influenced by what comes to mind more easily. "System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and quantity of information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions" (TFAS). If retrieval is easy, a category will be judged to be large. A salient event that attracts attention will be easily retrieved from memory. Dramatic events temporarily increase the availability of its category in memory. Personal experiences, pictures, and vivid examples are always more available in memory.
